Quake 2 Mod Project

This mod turns Quake 2 into an Overwatch-like game, with 3 different classes and two heroes in each class. The heroes included are D.Va, Reinhardt, Tracer, Hanzo, Kiriko, and Baptiste.

This mod is played by using the selected hero's kit to secure an objective point on the map. For the sake of testing in a single player environment, the player must defend the objective from AI monsters as they try and capture it. Monsters on the point will contest it and halt capture progression. Successful capture of the objective is victory.

Players can switch what hero they are playing as at any time.
